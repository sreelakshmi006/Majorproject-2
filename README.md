#  Fake News Detection System
The Fake News Detection System is a machine learning project that analyzes text data (news articles, posts, or tweets) to classify it as “Real” or “Fake”.

It:
Uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques
Trains a classification model (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM)
Evaluates performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)
Ideal for exploring NLP and Machine Learning for media and information quality.

## Features
✅ Data Preprocessing (Tokenization, Stop Words Removal, etc.)
✅ Feature Extraction (using Tfidf or Count Vectorization)
✅ Train a Machine Learning Model
✅ Evaluate Model Accuracy & Metrics
✅ Make Predictions on New Text Inputs

## Technologies Used
Python 3
scikit‑learn (Machine Learning Models, Evaluation)
pandas (Data Handling)
numpy (Calculations)
nltk/spacy (NLP Preprocessing)

## Usage
The program will:
Load the dataset of news articles.
Preprocess text (remove stop words, punctuation, etc.).
Train the chosen model (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM).
Evaluate the model and display results.
Accept user input (news headline or text) and predict if it’s Fake or Real.
